It's been 4 years since my last website redesign. Since I love experimenting with CSS and refreshing my image, I've decided to have another go at it.


You will notice that the new website departs pretty drastically from the old Jekyll theme. I've inspired myself off of simple and engineering-focused designs such as:
- [Berkeley Graphics](https://berkeleygraphics.com/)
- [1976 NASA Graphics Standards Manual](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nasa_graphics_manual_nhb_1430-2_jan_1976.pdf)
- Old, rectangular, and bezeled UIs (like Windows 98)

Those inspirations pushed me towards some form of visual minimalism but with high information density. 


The most distracting parts of the website (like the picture of my face and the animated grid of useless project pictures) have been removed.
