Catchy preface

# Why I Crashed Out 

Let me preface by saying that I do like Windows. It is an extremely customisable, stable, and reliable operating system. I've used it for *decades* and it has only failed me a couple times. This is an amazing track record for a piece of software that should affect everything I do on a computer. 

Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 10; these are all different faces of a precious friend that I've grown intimately familiar with since I was four. This kinship between man and machine has ruled my life. The Microsoft product in charge of interfacing all of my software with my hardware has given me endless amounts of joy, sorrow, and every other emotion in-between.

This dear friend has finally betrayed me. The slow creep of bloatware and ads has finally reached my desktop, my start menu, and my taskbar. Starting in Windows 10, Microsoft decided it was solid decision to start serving users ads that were **built into** the core functionality of the system. I wanted to overlook these changes as long as possible as I clung onto my precious video games.

With the announcement of the [Windows 10 end-of-life](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support) in October 2025, I toyed with the idea of not falling victim to the degradation of the system that nurtured my love for computers for so long. I was worried about switching operating system and the work that it would entail. I put off the thought for a while until something happened. The event that instantly cemented my resolve to completely ditch Windows was when I logged in one day to find a **FULL SCREEN COPILOT AD THAT CAME BACK AFTER I CLICK TO EXIT IT**.

I could not wait any longer to jump out of the burning plane and I'm glad I did.
