**Status**: Done, might redo eventually.

SatTrak is a program made to solve a problem with the RTL-SDR setup I was using to capture sattelite downlink. It was annoying to run outside every time I needed to ajust the attidude of my antennnae, so I decided to automate something to do it for me. Simply put, it is modular antenna controlling software with a bunch of cool features such as: 

- Visualisations of the night sky above you and all the sattelites
- Information about the selected sattelites
- Able to control a robotic antenna setup and follow the trajectory of the sattelite
- Able to track the sun and moon for radio astronomy
- Able to manually point the antenna at a set of sky coordinates
