TODO: Add pictures and videos of SatTrak.

**Status**: Done, yearning for a v2.

SatTrak is a program made to solve a problem with the RTL-SDR setup I was using to capture satellite downlink. It was annoying to run outside every time I needed to adjust the attitude of my antennae, so I decided to automate the process. Simply put, it is modular antenna-controlling software with a bunch of cool features such as: 

- Visualisations of the night sky above you and all the satellites.
- Information about the selected satellites.
- Able to control a robotic antenna setup and follow the trajectory of the satellite.
- Able to track the sun and moon for radio astronomy.
- Able to manually point the antenna at a set of sky coordinates.
