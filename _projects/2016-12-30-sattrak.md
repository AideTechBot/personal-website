**Status**: Done, might remake

SatTrak is software I made when I ran into a problem with my RTL-SDR setup I was using to capture sattelite downlink. It was annoying to run outside every time I needed to ajust the attidude of my antennnae, so I decided to code something to do it for me. Simply put, it's a modular antennae controller with a bunch of cool features. Oh, and you can also track the moon/sun if you are into radio astronomy.
