**Status**: Done.

This project is an electronic voting system designed for student governments. It enables the students to vote for their candidate of choice through their electronic devices. Wether it be an iPad, Android phone or laptop, every device that can run a web-browser supports it.

The students vote through a web portal that can be accessed on any device. The portal was written in PHP and MySQL. While the students vote, the count can be tallied and analyzed through an admin application made in C# and WPF.
