**Status**: Released and unmaintained.

`brs-cpp` is a library that allows you to read and write to [Brickadia](https://brickadia.com/) save files using C++. It is written as a single header file to make installation easy. It was made for the [Brickadia Community](https://github.com/brickadia-community) and it is probably wildly out of date since it is unmaintained.
