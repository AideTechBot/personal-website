Write a really in depth explanation for this with more pictures and maybe refactor and redo my code

 **Status**: Semi-functional, never finished.

Textr was a WPF app that connected to a Bluetooth enabled smartphone to send and recieve SMS messages. It was powered by the same Message Access Protocol that auto manufacturers use to implement the same functionality in automobiles.

I was able to get the SMS fetching/sending to work but I never finished the UI so it was never in a state to be released. The Bluetooth Message Access Protocol is definitely something I will revisit in the future because there is a lot of potential for really interesting desktop apps.
